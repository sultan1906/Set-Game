BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. using the env.config when needed to write a number, or a final variable if the config does not have it.
2. When we declared the size of arrays or for loops.
3. we changed the numbers in the configuration properties and the program ran by the current values.
--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1.terminate the players and then wait for the players to join the dealer.
2. in terminate() method in dealer.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

when the player send a set to the dealer he is waiting until he checks it.
when the ai trying to press and the key Presses queue is full it waits until there is room.
